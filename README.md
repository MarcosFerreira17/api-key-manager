### **Project Title:**
API Key Manager with Scopes and Roles Validation for Service APIs

### **Project Sponsor:**
Internal Development Team

### **Document Version:**
1.0

---

## **1. Executive Summary**
This project aims to design and implement an API Key Manager system to streamline authentication and authorization for APIs within the organization. The system will validate API keys, manage access permissions through roles and scopes, and integrate seamlessly into existing applications using a lightweight NuGet package. This solution simplifies the client-side implementation while ensuring security and compliance.

---

## **2. Goals and Objectives**

### **Goals:**
1. Provide a secure mechanism for API authentication using API keys.
2. Manage and enforce fine-grained access control through roles and scopes.
3. Enable easy integration with client applications via a reusable NuGet package.
4. Eliminate the need for token-based systems (e.g., JWT) to simplify operations.

### **Objectives:**
1. Develop an API Key Manager service to handle key creation, validation, and permission management.
2. Implement middleware and attribute-based validation to ensure secure and efficient authorization.
3. Create a robust error-handling and logging system for monitoring unauthorized access attempts.

## **3. Business Requirements**

### **3.1 Functional Requirements**

#### **API Key Management Service**
- Allow administrators to create, update, and delete API keys.
- Store API keys securely in a database with encryption.
- Assign roles and scopes to API keys (e.g., `admin`, `read:data`, `write:data`).
- Provide an endpoint for API key validation, returning:
  - Key status (active/inactive).
  - Associated roles and scopes.

#### **Integration Middleware (NuGet Package)**
- Validate incoming API keys from client requests.
- Enforce access control based on the required scope or role for the endpoint.
- Provide an attribute for easy integration into controllers (e.g., `[ApiKeyAuthorize("read:data")]`).
- Handle missing or invalid API keys with appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - 401 Unauthorized: Missing API key.
  - 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions.

#### **Roles and Scopes Management**
- Define and manage roles such as `admin`, `user`, `read-only`.
- Define scopes at a granular level, such as `read:data` or `write:config`.
- Support hierarchical roles (e.g., `admin` implicitly has `user` permissions).

#### **Client Applications**
- Ensure the integration process for client APIs is straightforward:
  - Configure middleware in the startup file.
  - Use the `[ApiKeyAuthorize]` attribute for endpoint-level authorization.
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for client integration.

### **3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Scalability:** Support a large number of API key validations per second.
- **Performance:** Validation responses should be completed within 50ms.
- **Security:** Ensure API keys are stored and transmitted securely.
- **Reliability:** Maintain 99.9% uptime for the API Key Manager service.
- **Usability:** Provide an intuitive interface for administrators to manage keys.
- **Maintainability:** Codebase must adhere to clean architecture principles.

---

## **4. Scope**

### **In Scope:**
- API Key Manager for centralized key creation and validation.
- NuGet package for middleware and attribute-based validation.
- Secure storage and retrieval of API keys.
- Role and scope-based access control.

### **Out of Scope:**
- Token-based systems (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- User authentication or session management.
- Front-end user interfaces for key management (CLI or API endpoints only).

---

## **5. Key Deliverables**

1. **API Key Manager Service:**
   - RESTful endpoints for API key creation, validation, and management.
   - Secure database for storing API keys and associated permissions.

2. **NuGet Package:**
   - Middleware for API key validation.
   - Attribute for scope and role validation.
   - Comprehensive documentation for integration.

3. **Documentation:**
   - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger).
   - Setup guides for client applications.
   - Role and scope management instructions.

---

## **6. Success Criteria**

- API keys are securely managed and validated for all client applications.
- Scopes and roles are enforced for every endpoint with minimal performance overhead.
- The NuGet package is successfully integrated into at least 3 client APIs.
- Comprehensive documentation is available, reducing onboarding time for new services to under 1 hour.

## **7. Risks and Mitigation**

| **Risk**                            | **Impact**         | **Likelihood** | **Mitigation**                          |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| API key leakage                    | High               | Medium         | Encrypt keys and limit database access.  |
| Performance degradation on validation | Medium            | Low            | Optimize database queries and cache results. |
| Misconfiguration of client APIs    | Medium             | Medium         | Provide clear documentation and examples. |

## **8. Timeline and Milestones**

| **Milestone**                        | **Target Date**  |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| API Key Manager service completed    | [Insert Date]    |
| NuGet package development completed  | [Insert Date]    |
| Documentation finalized              | [Insert Date]    |
